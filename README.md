NGPME is an advanced, web-based application that leverages computer vision to provide detailed gait analysis for prosthetic limb users. By simply uploading a video of themselves walking, users can receive objective, data-driven feedback on their mobility, helping them and their clinicians monitor progress and identify areas for improvement.

## ## Key Features

* üîê **Secure User Authentication**: Full signup and login system with bcrypt password hashing to ensure user data is private and secure.
* üëÅÔ∏è **Computer Vision Gait Tracking**: Utilizes Google's MediaPipe Pose model to accurately detect 33 body landmarks without needing special markers or equipment.
* üìä **Key Performance Metrics**: Automatically calculates critical gait parameters, including:
    * Total Step Count
    * Left & Right Knee Angles
    * Gait Asymmetry (comparing the motion of both legs)
* üöÄ **Performance Optimized**: Incorporates Region of Interest (ROI) Tracking and intelligent frame skipping to ensure fast analysis times on standard hardware.
* üìà **Data Smoothing for Accuracy**: Raw angle data is processed with a Simple Moving Average (SMA) filter to reduce model jitter and provide more stable results.
* üé® **Interactive Data Visualization**: Generates an interactive Plotly chart showing knee angle flexion and extension over time.
* üóÑÔ∏è **Persistent User History**: All analysis sessions are automatically saved to a SQLite database, linked to the user's account for tracking progress.
